## **Details**:

This project uses the `PokÃ©mon` and `Star Wars` API. Upon landing on the page, a new `FetchFunData` class is instantiated and each fetches their respective fantasy characters. Once fetched, the data is injected into the DOM within two `ul`'s living in a container called `div.data`


> _In the case there there is an error in the request, `div#errorContainer` is injected with an error message and a sad `.gif`._
